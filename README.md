# Guide to Undergraduate Thesis

## Introduction

Research is a fundamental aspect of academia, driving innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. As an undergraduate student, engaging in independent research helps develop essential skills in inquiry, experimentation, and scholarly communication. This guide provides a structured plan to navigate the research process over two semesters (each approximately 15 weeks), ensuring meaningful contributions to your chosen field.

## Understanding Research and Thesis Work

A research thesis is a substantive, research-oriented creative work that demonstrates mastery over a specific topic within a professional field. Undergraduate research aims to:

- Develop research questions and hypotheses.
- Identify research gaps and establish a strong theoretical foundation.
- Conduct rigorous experimentation and data analysis.
- Maintain research integrity and awareness of ethical considerations.
- Communicate findings through structured writing and presentations.

In this guide, we will outline milestones, resources, and deliverables to help students successfully complete their research thesis within two semesters.

## Timeline Overview

- Discuss research direction with the advisor and finalize the study plan
- Get research ethics approval (if applicable)

#### 2. Methodology Design and Environment Setup
- Develop a clear research methodology and define key variables
- Set up necessary software, tools, and experimental environments
- Define evaluation metrics and data collection procedures

#### 3. Experimentation and Data Collection
- Execute planned experiments in a controlled environment
- Collect and organize data systematically
- Document initial observations and challenges
- Maintain detailed records of all experimental procedures
- Iterate on experimental design based on initial results
- Present progress update to advisor

#### 4. Research Proposal & Presentation
- Synthesize findings and methodology into a formal research proposal
- Document preliminary results and future research plans
- Present proposal to the research committee
- Outline timeline and objectives for semester 2
- Get approval to proceed with advanced research phase

### Semester 2

#### 5. Advanced Experimentation
- Continue experiments based on proposal feedback
- Refine experimental methods as needed
- Complete all data collection
- Document all procedures and results thoroughly
- Regular check-ins with advisor on progress

#### 6. Data Analysis & Interpretation
- Apply statistical or computational methods for analysis
- Interpret results and compare with existing literature
- Identify key findings and contributions
- Develop visualizations and tables
- Discuss insights with advisor

#### 7. Thesis Writing & Draft
- Outline thesis structure
- Write methodology and results sections
- Draft discussion and conclusions
- Prepare figures and tables
- Submit draft for advisor feedback

#### 8. Final Revisions & Presentation

- Submit work for publication consideration

## Deliverables

### Semester 1:
- **Research Proposal :** Clearly defined research objectives, methodology, and literature review.

### Semester 2:
- **Final Thesis (End of Semester 2):** A structured research document with a thorough discussion of results and future work.
- **Journal Submission (End of Semester 2):** A research article submitted to a relevant journal for publication.
